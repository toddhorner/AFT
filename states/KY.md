## Kentucky - Planning & Zoning Scorecard

### State Planning

#### State Planning Capacity

**NO**

1.  The Cabinet of Economic Development does not engage in land use planning activities.
2.  The KY Transportation Cabinet includes a Planning Division, but, as could be expected, the Division focuses on transportation planning, and does not engage in broader planning work.
3.  The Governor's Office of Agricultural Policy does not focus on farmland preservation. It supports the development of the agricultural sector by providing grants and financing to farm businesses. It oversees the Kentucky Agricultural Development Board and the Kentucky Agricultural Finance Corporation Board.

####  State Plan for Agriculture

**YES**

1.  The Kentucky Agricultural Council (KAC) published the Strategic Plan for Kentucky Agriculture. KAC is a non-profit organization, but with state and federal agencies listed as partners.

#### State Planning Goals Relate to Agriculture

**NO**

1.  Planning goals are set on a county-by-county basis.

#### State provides grants or technical assistance to support development of local comprehensive plans or farmland protection plans.

**NO**

1. No, any assistance occurs at the county level.

#### State tracking of local plans

**NO**

1. State law requires any planning unit with a planning commission to adopt a comprehensive plan (see below), but review of adopted/updated plans falls to the town/city/county legislature. (KY RS 100.197)
2.  No evidence shows that any state entity tracks local plans. State government lacks a state agency that focuses on planning issues and that would conceivably oversee such work.


#### State planning goals related to compact development/smart growth

**NO**

1.  Billy van Pelt's suggestion is that smart growth needs to be more well defined to understand this indicator, or the concept in general.

### Local Planning

#### Requires localities to develop comprehensive plans

**YES**

1.  The planning commission of each local government unit must adopt a comprehensive plan (KY RS 100.183)
2.  However, a planning commission is *required* only in counties with a population of 300,000 or greater or counties with a consolidated form of government. In other cases, a planning commission is required as a condition for engaging in planning/zoning.
2.  Bill van Pelt was under the impression that Kentucky requires counties to adopt a comprehensive plan.
4. All comprehensive plans must be updated every five years. (RS 100.197)
5. As an interesting side note, if the local legislative body takes no action on a proposed plan adoption/update, then, after 90 days, the plan is considered approved by default.

#### Require localities to address agricultural issues in their local plans

**YES**

1.  Agriculture is an optional topic in the required land use chapter:
    >A land use plan element, which shall show proposals for the most appropriate,economic, desirable, and feasible patterns for the general location, character, extent, and interrelationship of the manner in which the community should use its public and private land at specified times as far into the future as is reasonable to foresee. Such land uses may cover, without being limited to, public and private, residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, and recreational land uses;
    >
    >KY RS 100.187

2.  However, the research required in support of a comprehensive plan shoud include:
    >the identification and mapping of agricultural lands of statewide importance and analysis of the impacts of community land use needs on these lands
    >
    >KY RS 100.191

#### Require localities to protect agricultural resources in their local plans

**NO**

1.  See above

#### Require localities to support compact/efficient development in designated growth areas

**NO**

1.   Any smart-growth provisions are enacted on a county-by-county basis.
