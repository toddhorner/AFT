## Rhode Island - Planning & Zoning Scorecard

### State Planning

#### State Planning Capacity

**PARTIAL**

1.  The NV Department of Economic Development has a [Rural Community and Economic Development Division](), but land use is not a listed mission area. Emailed the director to confirm.
2.  Reno, the City of Sparks, and Washoe County are served by the [Truckee-Meadows Regional Planning Agency](http://tmrpa.org/about-tmrpa/about-tmrpa/). Although its creation was mandated by state law [(NRS 278.0264)](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-278.html#NRS278Sec0264), members of its Regional Planning Governing Board and Regional Planning Commission are appointed by local governments.
3.  The Tahoe Region is served by the [Tahoe Regional Planning Commission](http://www.trpa.org/about-trpa/how-we-operate/). The TRPA
    >operates under the authority of the states of California and Nevada and the federal government through the Bi-State Compact, which was ratified by Congress and signed by the President of the United States.

    About one third of the TRPA's 202,000 acre service region lies in Nevada.

#### State Plan for Agriculture

**NO**

1.  The NV Dept. of Health and Human Services Grants Management Unit published a [state food security plan](http://www.diversifynevada.com/uploads/studies/StrategicPlanFoodSecurityinNV_020713.pdf) in 2013. The plan focuses on preventing hunger and malnutrition. Although it does include goals related to increasing the consumption of local foods, it doesn't address preservation of agricultural resources.
2.  In 2014, the NV Governor's Office of Economic Development published [*"Nevada Agricultural Report: Analysis and Opportunities"*](http://www.diversifynevada.com/uploads/studies/2013nvagreport.pdf). The plan does not include a chapter of recommendations related to land use or farmland protection. Conversely, it does include recommendations related to the promotion of hydroponics and vertical farming:
    >Expand local based agriculture through vertical farming and hydroponic growing operations. Focus efforts on expanding technology adoption within the state and the  promotion and education of businesses to establish and succeed. Seek out empty buildings within communities and support their transition to growing centers.
3.
