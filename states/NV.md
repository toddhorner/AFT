## Rhode Island - Planning & Zoning Scorecard

### State Planning

#### State Planning Capacity

**YES**

1.  The Nevada Division of State Lands includes both a
    * [State Land Use Planning Agency](http://lands.nv.gov/program/slupa.htm), which
      > provides technical planning assistance to local governments and other agencies, and represents the state on federal land management activities.

      The SLUPA also assists counties create [Public Land Use Plans](http://lands.nv.gov/program/slupa.htm), which
      >provide local governments with a strong voice in federal planning related matters such land use and natural resource plans updates and NEPA reviews for public land development proposals.  The National Environmental Policy Act requires consultation between federal state and local governments. These plans are a major tool in fostering collaboration between various levels of government.

      It should be noted that approximately 85% of Nevada land is federally owned.

    * and a [State Land Use Planning Advisory Council](http://lands.nv.gov/program/slupac.htm). The SLUPAC
      >is the Administrator's Advisory Board on land use issues. The Governor appoints the seventeen members of SLUPAC, one from each county. SLUPAC meets several times a year to discuss land use planning issues. The State Land Use Planning staff provides support for this council.

1.  The NV Department of Economic Development has a [Rural Community and Economic Development Division](), but land use is not a listed mission area. Emailed the director to confirm.
2.  Reno, the City of Sparks, and Washoe County are served by the [Truckee-Meadows Regional Planning Agency](http://tmrpa.org/about-tmrpa/about-tmrpa/). Although its creation was mandated by state law [(NRS 278.0264)](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-278.html#NRS278Sec0264), members of its Regional Planning Governing Board and Regional Planning Commission are appointed by local governments.
3.  The Tahoe Region is served by the [Tahoe Regional Planning Commission](http://www.trpa.org/about-trpa/how-we-operate/). The TRPA
    >operates under the authority of the states of California and Nevada and the federal government through the Bi-State Compact, which was ratified by Congress and signed by the President of the United States.

    About one third of the TRPA's 202,000 acre service region lies in Nevada.

#### State Plan for Agriculture

**NO**

1.  The NV Dept. of Health and Human Services Grants Management Unit published a [state food security plan](http://www.diversifynevada.com/uploads/studies/StrategicPlanFoodSecurityinNV_020713.pdf) in 2013. The plan focuses on preventing hunger and malnutrition. Although it does include goals related to increasing the consumption of local foods, it doesn't address preservation of agricultural resources.
2.  In 2014, the NV Governor's Office of Economic Development published [*"Nevada Agricultural Report: Analysis and Opportunities"*](http://www.diversifynevada.com/uploads/studies/2013nvagreport.pdf). The plan does not include a chapter of recommendations related to land use or farmland protection. Conversely, it does include recommendations related to the promotion of hydroponics and vertical farming:
    >Expand local based agriculture through vertical farming and hydroponic growing operations. Focus efforts on expanding technology adoption within the state and the  promotion and education of businesses to establish and succeed. Seek out empty buildings within communities and support their transition to growing centers.

#### State Planning Goals Related to Agriculture

**NO**

1.  Statute contains natural resource preservation goals that relate to conservation districts. [RS 548.095](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-548.html#NRS548Sec095) states that
    > *  (1) That the renewable natural resources of the State of Nevada are basic assets.
    >     *   (2) That they are being affected by the ever-increasing demands of farm and ranch operations and by changes in land use from agricultural to nonagricultural uses, such as, but not limited to, residential and commercial developments, highways and airports.

    Neither statute nor any official planning document contain goals that link agricultural preservation with land use planning.



#### State provides grants or technical assistance to support development of local comprehensive plans or farmland protection plans.

**YES**

1.  [The State Land Use Planning Agency](http://lands.nv.gov/program/slupa.htm)
    >provides technical land use planning assistance to local governments upon request. This assistance is wide-ranging and includes help with community planning, land use and natural resources issues, and development of Public Land Policy Plans.


#### State tracking of local plans


1.  Need to confirm with Skip Canfield at (775) 684-2723
2.  The NV Research Division [inventories county and city zoning codes](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Division/Research/Library/Links/Codes.html).

#### State planning goals related to compact development/smart growth

**NO**

1.  None identified in statute or official planning document. Emailed Skip Canfield to verify. Also emailed NV chapter of the APA.

### Local Planning

#### Requires localities to develop comprehensive plans

**PARTIAL**

1.  [NRS 270.030](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-278.html#NRS278Sec030) requires that each city with a population of at least 25,000 and each county with a population of at least 45,000 must create a planning commission. [NRS 278.150](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-278.html#NRS278Sec150), in turn, states that
    >The planning commission shall prepare and adopt a comprehensive, long-term general plan for the physical development of the city, county or region which in the commission’s judgment bears relation to the planning thereof.

#### Require localities to address agricultural issues in their local plans

**PARTIAL**

1.  A county with a population of 700,000 or more must include in its master plan a conservation element. Said element "must include":
    > a conservation plan for the conservation, development and utilization of natural resources, including, without limitation, water and its hydraulic force, underground water, water supply, solar or wind energy, forests, **soils**, rivers and other waters, harbors, fisheries, wildlife, minerals and other natural resources.

2. If a county with a population of 100,000-700,000 adopts a master plan, then it must include the aforementioned conservation plan.  [(NRS 278.150)](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-278.html#NRS278Sec150)

#### Require localities to protect agricultural resources in their local plans

**NO**

1.  See above.

#### Require localities to support compact/efficient development in designated growth areas

**PARTIAL**

1.  A city or county master plan *may* include a land use element. If it does include a land use element, then said element **must** include a land use plan. A land use plan "must, if applicable":
    > * address mixed-use development, transit-oriented development, master-planned communities...

    Note that for a county with a population of at least 700,000, the master plan **must** include a land use element, and thus a land use plan.

2.  In a county whose population is 700,000 or more, the aforementioned land use plan **must** include:
    >a rural neighborhoods preservation plan showing general plans to preserve the character and density of rural neighborhoods. [(278.160.1 (d)(3)](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-278.html#NRS278Sec160)
