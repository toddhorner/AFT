## West Virginia - Planning & Zoning Scorecard

### State Planning

#### State Planning Capacity

**NO**

1.  All of WV lies within the Appalachian Regional Commission's service area. Land use and comprehensive planning, however, is not one of ARC's program areas.
2.  VA Dept. of Ag does not include a conservation or land protection division.
3. Other than hosting a database of development-ready properties, the WV Dept. of Commerce does not engage in land use activities. Its division of Community Advancement and Development Division focuses on economic development and revitalization.
4.  Statute dictates that the Governor's Office
    >facilitate the coordination of planning and development activities of all state departments, agencies and institutions; local governments; regional councils; and other public and private agencies within the state;
    >
    >§8-25-3 (3)

    It's not clear, however, to what extent the current administration or past administrations have fulfilled that function.
5.  At least some Regional Planning and Development Councils perform land use planning functions. The governor's office originally coordinated the formation of RPDCs, authorized by §8-25-5. RPDCs, however, are governed by their member municipalities, and do not take direction from the Governor's Office. They are funded through ad hoc grants and member dues (as specified in §8-25-12)

####  State Plan for Agriculture

**NO**

1.  No state entity has published a farm or food systems plan.

#### State Planning Goals Relate to Agriculture

**NO**

1. No state office has published planning goals. Statute does not provide specify planning goals.

#### State provides grants or technical assistance to support development of local comprehensive plans or farmland protection plans.

**NO**

1.  At least some RPDCs provide technical assistance on land use issues, including work on local comprehensive plans. The state does not provide funding for these activities, though.

#### State tracking of local plans

**NO**

1.  Evidence does not suggest that any state entity, including the governor's office, tracks local plans.

#### State planning goals related to compact development/smart growth

**NO**

1. No state office has published planning goals. Statute does not provide specify planning goals.

### Local Planning

#### Requires localities to develop comprehensive plans

**NO**

1.  Counties and municipalities are authorized, but not required to create a planning commission [(WV State Code §8A-2-1)](http://www.legis.state.wv.us/WVCODE/Code.cfm?chap=08a&art=2#02). Planning commissions, once created, are required to prepare and recommend a comprehensive plan to the locality's governing body (§8A-3-3.). Statute, however does not mandate that the governing body *adopt* the proposed comprehensive plan.

#### Require localities to address agricultural issues in their local plans

**YES**

1.  A locality's comprehensive plan "shall have" a land use element:

    >(1) Land use. -- Designate the current, and set goals and programs for the proposed general distribution, location and suitable uses of land, including, but not limited to:
    >
    > * (A) Residential, commercial, industrial, **agricultural**, recreational, educational, public, historic, conservation, transportation, infrastructure or any other use of land
    >
    >§8A-3-4 (1)(A)

#### Require localities to protect agricultural resources in their local plans

**NO**

1.  See above. Localities' comprehensive plans are required only to "set goals" regarding agriculture.

#### Require localities to support compact/efficient development in designated growth areas

**YES**

1. A locality's comprehensive plan must include a rural component:

  > Rural. -- Consistent with the land use component, identify land that is not intended for urban growth and set goals, plans and programs for growth and/or decline management in the designated rural area.
  >
  >§8A-3-4 (c)(6)
