## Utah - Planning & Zoning Scorecard

### State Planning

#### State Planning Capacity

**YES**

1.  Utah State Code [63J-4-401](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title63J/Chapter4/63J-4-S401.html) outlines the duties of the State Planning Coordinator (SPC), who serves at the pleasure of the governor and under the auspices of the [Governor's Office of Management and Budget](https://gomb.utah.gov/budget-policy/planning/).

    Statute dictates that the SPC shall:

    > (a)	act as the governor's adviser on state, regional, metropolitan, and local governmental planning matters relating to public improvements and land use;
    >[...]
    > (g)	act as the governor's planning agent in planning public improvements and land use and, in this capacity, undertake special studies and investigations;

    Statute then proceeds to outline various principles and findings that the SPC shall promote when engaged in any planning activities related to **federal** lands.

    The State Planning Coordinator's office also provides administrative/staff support to the Quality Growth Commission (see below for more info).

2.  The Utah Quality Growth Act of 1999 created the



####  State Plan for Agriculture

#### State Planning Goals Relate to Agriculture

#### State provides grants or technical assistance to support development of local comprehensive plans or farmland protection plans.

**YES**

1.  Section [11-38-203](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title11/Chapter38/11-38-S203.html) of Utah State Code - entitled "Commission may provide assistance to local entities" - provides that the Quality Growth Commission "may":

    > - (1)	from funds appropriated to the Governor's Office of Management and Budget by the Legislature for this purpose, **grant money to local entities to help them obtain the technical assistance** they need to:
    >   - (a)	conduct workshops or public hearings or use other similar methods to obtain public input and participation in the process of identifying for that entity the principles of quality growth referred to in Subsection 11-38-202(1)(f);
    >   - (b)	identify where and how quality growth areas could be established within the local entity; and
    >   - (c)	**develop or modify the local entity's general plan to incorporate and implement the principles of quality growth** developed by the local entity and to establish quality growth areas; and
    > - (2)	require each local entity to which the commission grants money under Subsection (1) to report to the commission, in a format and upon a timetable determined by the commission, on that local entity's process of developing quality growth principles and on the quality growth principles developed by that local entity.

2.  [The Land Use Academy of Utah (LUAU)](https://luau.utah.gov/) was:

    > funded by the Utah State Legislature and created by a consortium of public and private sectors to provide uniform professional education to the stateâ€™s civic leaders and the general public.



3.  


#### State tracking of local plans



#### State planning goals related to compact development/smart growth

**YES**

1.  Utah's goals related to smart growth are evinced by the enactment of the "Quality Growth Act" [(Utah State Law 11-38)](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title11/Chapter38/11-38.html). The Act created the state's [Quality Growth Commission](https://utahqualitygrowth.wordpress.com/) (see above for more info). Statute, unfortunately, does not define "quality growth," and the Commission has no regulatory power. Consequently, goals are squishy. Statute, does, however, does grant the commission the power to require a review process for any locality receiving technical assistance from the Commission:

    > The Commission may:
    > [...]
    >(2)	require each local entity to which the commission grants money under Subsection (1) to report to the commission, in a format and upon a timetable determined by the commission, on that local entity's process of developing quality growth principles and on the quality growth principles developed by that local entity.

    TO DO: follow-up with Commission staff/board regarding the amount of money actually appropriated for technical assistance.

### Local Planning

#### Requires localities to develop comprehensive plans

**YES**

1.  Utah state code requires that each municipality adopt a comprehensive plan:

    > * (1)	In order to accomplish the purposes of this chapter, each municipality shall prepare and adopt a comprehensive, long-range general plan for:
    >   * (a)	present and future needs of the municipality; and
    >   * (b)	growth and development of all or any part of the land within the municipality.

2.  Utah State Code requires that each county adopt a comprehensive plan that cover unincorporated areas:

    > * (1)	To accomplish the purposes of this chapter, each county shall prepare and adopt a comprehensive, long-range general plan:
    >   * (a)	for present and future needs of the county;
    >   * (b)
    >     * (i)	for growth and development of all or any part of the land within the unincorporated portions of the county; or
    >     * (ii)	if a county has designated a mountainous planning district, for growth and development of all or any part of the land within the mountainous planning district; and
    >    *  (c)	as a basis for communicating and coordinating with the federal government on land and resource management issues.


#### Require localities to address agricultural issues in their local plans

**NO**

1.  Statute suggests, but does not require, components of a comprehensive plan. UT State Code [10-9a-401 (2)(c)](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title10/Chapter9A/10-9a-S401.html?v=C10-9a-S401_1800010118000101) states that municipal plans **may** provide for:
    > - (c)	the efficient and economical use, conservation, and production of the supply of:
    >   - (i)	food and water;

2.  County general plans must contain "a resource management plan for public lands," which must address agriculture. Statute, however, does not specify requirements for addressing agriculture on private lands.

#### Require localities to protect agricultural resources in their local plans

**NO**

1.  See above

#### Require localities to support compact/efficient development in designated growth areas

**NO**

1.  As stated above, statute suggests, but does not require comprehensive plan content matter. State law [10-9a-401](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title10/Chapter9A/10-9a-S401.html?v=C10-9a-S401_1800010118000101) does suggest that plans **may** provide for:

    > (i)	identifying future uses of land that are likely to require an expansion or significant modification of services or facilities provided by each affected entity;
