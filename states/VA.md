### State Planning

#### State Planning Capacity

####  State Plan for Agriculture

**NO**

1.  No state entity has published a farm action plan or food systems plan. State government, through its land grant university extensions services, did contribute to the [Virginia Farm to Table Plan](https://pubs.ext.vt.edu/content/dam/pubs_ext_vt_edu/CV/CV-3/CV-3_lowrez_pdf.pdf). The plan focuses more on farm viability and food access than farmland preservation, but does address farmland preservation:
    > In collaborating to implement this Plan, we will grow jobs and
new entrepreneurs, encourage durable economic development
around farming and food, maintain farmland and working
landscapes, improve public health, increase food security, and
strengthen community viability for a stronger local food system
and brighter economic future.
