## Wisconsin - Planning & Zoning Scorecard

### State Planning

#### State Planning Capacity

**YES**

1.  [The Division of Intergovernmental Relations](http://doa.wi.gov/Divisions/Intergovernmental-Relations) within the Department of Administration:

    >provides a broad array of services to the public and state, local and tribal governments.   It supports counties, municipalities, citizens and businesses by providing support services in **land use planning**, land information and records modernization, municipal boundary review, plat review, demography, and coastal management programs.

2.  The Division has published guides on comprehensive planning issues. Funding for technical assistance, however, has diminished in recent years (see below).

####  State Plan for Agriculture

**NO**

1.  No state entity has published a farm action plan or food system plan.

#### State Planning Goals Relate to Agriculture

1.  Although state law requires local governments to include agricultural issues in comprehensive plans, neither statute nor administrative code defines proactive planning goals related to agriculture. Local governments are afforded discretion to determine their own goals.

#### State provides grants or technical assistance to support development of local comprehensive plans or farmland protection plans.

**MAYBE? - DEPENDS ON THRESHOLD**

1.  [From the Wisconsin Department of Administration](http://www.doa.state.wi.us/Divisions/Intergovernmental-Relations/Comprehensive-Planning/About-Comprehensive-Planning/):
    >The former Wisconsin Comprehensive Planning Grant Program financially assisted local governments in the development and adoption of comprehensive plans in the past. From 2000 through 2010, comprehensive planning grants were awarded to municipalities, counties, tribes, and regional planning commissions.
    >
    >No comprehensive planning grants have been awarded since 2010. No grants are planned for the future.

    Also, see below for a note on the minimal amount of time the Wisconsin Land Information Program grant administrator is able to dedicate towards technical assistance.

2.  The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture and UW Cooperative extension [published a guide](http://www.doa.state.wi.us/Documents/DIR/Comprehensive%20Planning/Element-Guides/Ag-Guide.pdf) (in 2002) on the relationship between agricultural issues and the comprehensive planning process.

#### State tracking of local plans

**YES**

1.  [From the Wisconsin Department of Administration](http://www.doa.state.wi.us/Divisions/Intergovernmental-Relations/Comprehensive-Planning/About-Comprehensive-Planning/):

 >The Wisconsin Land Information Program grant administrator assumes the following responsibilities related to local government comprehensive planning, but is only able to dedicate a small portion of his time toward them:
 >
 >  * Maintaining a record of plans adopted
 >  * Answering common questions about comprehensive planning from land owners, local officials, and planning agencies

 2. The DOA offers a list of adopted plans online at: [http://www.doa.state.wi.us/Divisions/Intergovernmental-Relations/Comprehensive-Planning](http://www.doa.state.wi.us/Divisions/Intergovernmental-Relations/Comprehensive-Planning)


#### State planning goals related to compact development/smart growth

**NOT ANYMORE, IF EVER**

1.  WI Statute 16.965 governs how the Department of Administration awards planning grants to municipalities. In evaluating applications, the law instructs the DOA to give preference to applications that include "planning efforts that identify smart growth areas." Statute 16.965 (1)(a) defines a smart growth area as:

    >an area that will enable the development and redevelopment of lands with existing infrastructure and municipal, state and utility services, where practicable, or that will encourage efficient development patterns that are both contiguous to existing development and at densities that have relatively low municipal, state governmental and utility costs.

However, as stated above, no planning grants have been awarded since 2010, and there are no plans to fund more grants.

### Local Planning

#### Requires localities to develop comprehensive plans

**YES**

1.  Municipalities must have a comprehensive plan in order adopt or update land use ordinance. According to WI Statute 6.1001 (3):

    >Beginning on January 1, 2010, if a local governmental unit enacts or amends any of the following ordinances, the ordinance shall be consistent with that local governmental unit's comprehensive plan:
    > * (g) Official mapping ordinances enacted or amended under s. 62.23 (6).
    > * (h) Local subdivision ordinances enacted or amended under s. 236.45 or 236.46.
    > * (j) County zoning ordinances enacted or amended under s. 59.69.
    > * (k) City or village zoning ordinances enacted or amended under s. 62.23 (7).
    > * (L) Town zoning ordinances enacted or amended under s. 60.61 or 60.62.
    > * (q) Shorelands or wetlands in shorelands zoning ordinances enacted or amended under s. 59.692, 61.351, 61.353, 62.231, or 62.233.

2.  I wonder if requiring a municipality to adopt a comprehensive plan in order to *update* land use ordinance creates a disincentive for improving poor code.

3.  From Brief 15-12 of the WI Legislative Reference Bureau:

    >Zoning and other land use actions continue, even in places that have not fully implemented a comprehensive plan. Some municipalities may be operating under a pre- 1999 plan, fulfilling the letter of the law relating to consistency requirements; others may have a grant application pending or be acting under a DOA extension, which, under the amended at the latest. There has been no court ruling on exactly to what extent local governments are constrained by their comprehensive plans. Plans may be less binding than they appear when municipalities may amend their plans to bring nonconforming actions into conformity

4.  Counties must adopt farmland preservation plans [(WI Stat. 91.10 (1))](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/91/II/). Farmland preservation plans must include:

    >   * 1.  Agricultural uses of land in the county at the time that the farmland preservation plan is adopted, including key agricultural specialities, if any.
    > * 2. Key agricultural resources, including available land, soil, and water resources.
    > * 3. Key infrastructure for agriculture, including key processing, storage, transportation, and supply facilities.
    > * 4. Significant trends in the county related to agricultural land use, agricultural production, enterprises related to agriculture, and the conversion of agricultural lands to other uses.
    > * 5. Anticipated changes in the nature, scope, location, and focus of agricultural production, processing, supply, and distribution.
    > * 6. Goals for agricultural development in the county, including goals related to the development of enterprises related to agriculture.
    > * 7. Actions that the county will take to preserve farmland and to promote agricultural development.
    > * 7m. Policies, goals, strategies, and proposed actions to increase housing density in areas that are not identified under par. (d).
    > * 8. Key land use issues related to preserving farmland and to promoting agricultural development and plans for addressing those issues.

5.  If a county has a comprehensive plan, then its farmland preservation plan must be included in its comprehensive plan (WI Stat. 91.10 (2))


#### Require localities to address agricultural issues in their local plans

**YES**

1.  According to WI Statute 6.1001 (2), comprehensive plans must contain an Agricultural, Natural, and Cultural Resources Element, which comprises:

    >A compilation of objectives, policies, goals, maps and programs for the conservation, and promotion of the effective management, of natural resources such as groundwater, forests, productive agricultural areas, environmentally sensitive areas, threatened and endangered species, stream corridors, surface water, floodplains, wetlands, wildlife habitat, metallic and nonmetallic mineral resources consistent with zoning limitations under s. 295.20 (2), parks, open spaces, historical and cultural resources, community design, recreational resources and other natural resources.

#### Require localities to protect agricultural resources in their local plans

**YES**

1.  Plans must establish goals and objectives regarding agricultural resources. Land use decision must be consistent with those goals and objectives.

#### Require localities to support compact/efficient development in designated growth areas

**NO**

1.  Although Wisconsin's comprehensive planning program, enacted into law by 1999 Wisconsin Act 9, is also known as Wisconsin's "Smart Growth" Initiative, density requirements are left to the discretion of the locality. A comprehensive plan must contain a land use element (Statute 6.1001 (h)), which must specify:

    >the boundaries of areas to which services of public utilities and community facilities [...] will be provided in the future

    Also, the land use element must list existing densities of current land use, projections of land use based on assumed net densities, but *is not* required to specify target/mandatory minimum or maximum densities.
