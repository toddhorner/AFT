## North Carolina - Planning & Zoning Scorecard

### State Planning

#### State Planning Capacity

**NO**

1.  The Rural Development Division of the Department of Commerce has several [Rural Planning Offices](http://www.nccommerce.com/rd/community-assistance/economic-advancement-and-planning/regional-office-services), but they focus on Economic Development, not Land Use.
2.  Also, per e-mail correspondence with Benjamin Howell, AICP, VP for Chapter Development, APA-NC.
    >The state does have a network of COGs that receive some state funding, but the funding is limited and targeted to specific functions.  Many COGs rely on member jurisdictions' dues to fund their planning technical assistance functions.
3.   NC Dept. of Agriculture has a [Farmland Preservation Division](http://www.ncadfp.org/), but its work focuses on farm viability and PACE, not comprehensive planning.
4.  The [Center for Environmental Farming Systems](https://cefs.ncsu.edu/), a partnership of North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, and North Carolina State University, does conduct research and publish guides related to food systems planning. For example, their [Government Guide on Building Local Food Economies](https://cefs.ncsu.edu/food-system-initiatives/local-food-economies/a-government-guide-on-building-local-food-economies) contains a substantial chapter on planning and land use.

####  State Plan for Agriculture

**NO**

1.  ["Farm to Fork: A Guide to Building North Carolina’s Sustainable Local Food Economy"](https://ncfoodstrategy.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/action_nc_2010_stateactionguide2010.pdf), published by the Center for Environmental Farm Systems, comes closest to resembling a state plan for agriculture. CEFS is a partnership between NC land grant universities and the NC Dept. of Ag. The guide includes a chapter on farmland preservation. It was published in 2010, and does not include time horizons for implementation of policy recommendations.

#### State Planning Goals Related to Agriculture

**NO**

1.  [N.C. Gen Stat.106-700](http://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_106/GS_106-700.pdf) declares that:
    >It is the declared policy of the State to conserve and protect and encourage the development and improvement of its agricultural land and forestland for the production of food, fiber, and other products.

    The above declaration, however, is set forth within the context of right-to-farm statute, which guards farms from prohibitive land use regulation or nuisance suits. Statute does not contain goals that relate agriculture to land use planning.

#### State provides grants or technical assistance to support development of local comprehensive plans or farmland protection plans.

**NO**

1.  From e-mail correspondence with Ben Howell:
    >Not really - The state Commerce Department does have a Rural Planning Group in their Rural Development division (http://www.nccommerce.com/rd) that can provide some technical assistance, but their staff and budget have been reduced over the past few budget cycles, which limits the assistance they can provide.
2.  The Dept. of Ag's involvement with the aforementioned Center for Environmental Farm Systems could be construed as indirect assistance. CEFS has published guides that address planning issues, as they relate to farmland preservation. CEFS, however, does not provide technical assistance or publish reports regarding comprehnsive planning more generally.
3.  From Roger Waldon FAICP:
    >The BEST resource for planning advice and assistance today, available to all local governments in North Carolina, is the School of Government at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.  This School, formerly a separate university institute called the Institute of Government, is now aligned with UNC’s Master of Public Administration program and  provides educational, advisory, and research services for state and local governments in NC. The School does not prepare any plans for local governments or the state, but provides up to 200 courses, webinars, and specialized conferences for more than 12,000 public officials each year. Faculty members respond to thousands of phone calls and e-mail messages each year on routine and urgent matters and also engage in long-term advising projects for local governing boards, legislative committees, and statewide commissions.  Faculty members annually publish approximately 50 books, manuals, reports, articles, bulletins, and other print and online content related to state and local government. 

#### State tracking of local plans

**NO**

1.  From e-mail correspondence with Ben Howell:
    >The state government does not, but the School of Government at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill does work to track this.  

#### State planning goals related to compact development/smart growth

**NO**

1.  No evidence of state-level smart growth goals. Corroborated by Ben Howell.

### Local Planning

#### Requires localities to develop comprehensive plans

**NO**

1.  According to [N.C. Gen. Stat. 153A-321](http://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/BySection/Chapter_153A/GS_153A-321.pdf), A county *may* create a planning board "to perform the following duties":

    > (1) Make studies of the county and surrounding areas;
      (2) Determine objectives to be sought in the development of the study area;
      (3) Prepare and adopt plans for achieving these objectives;
      [...]

2. If a county wishes to enact zoning ordinance, it must first adopt a comprehensive plan:
    > Zoning regulations shall be made in accordance with a comprehensive plan. Prior to adopting or rejecting any zoning amendment, the governing board shall adopt a statement describing whether its action is consistent with an adopted comprehensive plan and explaining why the board considers the action taken to be reasonable and in the public interest. That statement is not subject to judicial review. [(N.C. Gen. Stat. §153A-341)](http://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/ByArticle/Chapter_153A/Article_18.html)

3.  [N.C. Gen. Stat. §160A-361 and §160A-383](http://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/ByChapter/Chapter_160A.html) provide identical language for cities and towns.

#### Require localities to address agricultural issues in their local plans

**NO**

1. Statute does not specify any requirements for comprehensive plan content, for either county or municipal governments.

#### Require localities to protect agricultural resources in their local plans

**NO**

1.  See above.

#### Require localities to support compact/efficient development in designated growth areas

**NO**

1. Statute does not specify any requirements for comprehensive plan content, for either county or municipal governments.
