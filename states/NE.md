## Nebraska - Planning & Zoning Scorecard Notes

### State Planning

#### State Planning Capacity

**NO**

1.  NE Department of Economic Development has a [Community Development Division](https://opportunity.nebraska.gov/grow-your-community/), but all its programming aims at *encouraging* growth, not directing it.
2.  [NE Department of Agriculture](http://www.nda.nebraska.gov/) does not offer land use programming or employ staff planners.
3.  From personal communication with the NE chapter of the APA
    >The state does have a network of Development Districts (COGs). Some have tried to do comprehensive plans but they usually lack the staff and training to complete these on a regular basis. Only 1 Development District (PADD) has regularly worked in their region doing such work.

4.  From personal correspondence with Gordon Scholz, faculty at the Community and Regional Planning Program at University of Nebraska-Lincoln:
    >There is no significant traditional land use planning done at the state level in Nebraska.  The land use planning functions are delegated to local governments—counties and municipalities.

####  State Plan for Agriculture

**NO**

1.  No state agency, including the [Dept. of Economic Development](https://opportunity.nebraska.gov/), the [Department of Ag.](http://www.nda.nebraska.gov/), and the [Department of Natural Resources](https://dnr.nebraska.gov/), have developed a state agriculture plan.
2.  

#### State Planning Goals Related to Agriculture

**NO**

1.  No state law or planning document sets for agricultural goals related to planning or land use. The [Nebraska Right to Farm Act](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=2-4403) protects farming operations from nuisance suits, but does not specify *goals* that connect agriculture with planning or zoning.
2.  From personal corresponence with Prof. Scholze:
    >Nebraska has a right to farm statute: http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=2-4403
Otherwise, there are no significant specific planning goals related to agriculture – other than goals that might have been adopted by the Department of Agriculture or other state agencies.

#### State provides grants or technical assistance to support development of local comprehensive plans or farmland protection plans.

**NO**

2.  From personal communication with the NE chapter of the APA:
    >The Nebraska Department of Economic Development provides Planning Grants, which cover Comprehensive Plans, but the county must meet all Low- to Moderate Income requirements which is difficult. There is no state agency that directly writes plans.

2.  From correspondence with Prof. Scholz:
    >Nebraska state government does not track adoption and updates of local comprehensive plans, but indirectly the Nebraska Department of Economic Development would have records of planning processes (new plan adoptions or plan updates) that are being funded partially by Community Development Block Grant funds.  I don’t know how complete, how well organized, or how long that information is kept.

2.  Outside the parameters stated above, no state agency or program provides grants or technical assistance to support the development of local comprehensive plans or farmland protection plans.

#### State tracking of local plans

**NO**

1.  No state agency has the capacity or a mission to track local comprehensive plans. Confirmed with NE APA chapter.

#### State planning goals related to compact development/smart growth

**NO**

1.  No state law or planning document sets forth smart growth goals. Confirmed with NE APA chapter.
2.  Also, from correspondence with Prof. Scholz:
    >Nebraska has not adopted statewide planning goals related to smart growth.

### Local Planning

#### Requires localities to develop comprehensive plans

**PARTIAL**

1.  For NE counties, a comprehensive plan is required as a precondition for enacting zoning ordinance ([23-114.03](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=23-114.03)). Neither zoning nor a comprehensive plan are mandatory, however. [State law](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=13-301) encourages counties containing larger cities to adopt a comprehensive plan and zoning ordinance.
2.  [State law](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=14-373) requires that each city of "metropolitan class"
    >prepare a plan for its future physical development and growth.

    [NE RSA 14-101](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=14-101) stipulates that cities with a population greater then 300,000 are classified as metropolitan.
3.  In any city of the [primary class](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=15-101) (population 100,000-300,000),
    >there shall be created a planning department, which shall consist of a city planning commission, a planning director, and such subordinate employees as are required to administer the planning program hereinafter set forth. [(RSA 15-1101)](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=15-1101)

    The planning director
    >shall be responsible for preparing the comprehensive plan and amendments and extensions thereto and for submitting such plans and modifications to the city planning commission for its consideration and action. [(RSA 15-1103)](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=15-1103)

4.  In a city or town with a population less than 100,000 people, a comprehensive plan is required only as a precondition for adopting zoning ordinance. [(RSA 19-901)](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=19-901)




#### Require localities to address agricultural issues in their local plans

**NO**

1.  Statute requires that county comprehensive plans address agriculture, but only in the most general terms:
    >The general plan for the improvement and development of the county shall be known as the comprehensive development plan and shall, among other elements, include:
    >
    > * (1) A land-use element which designates the proposed general distribution, general location, and extent of the uses of land for agriculture, housing, commerce, industry, recreation, education, public buildings and lands, and other categories of public and private use of land. [(23-114.02)](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=23-114.02)

2.  A city of the "primary class" does not need to address agricultural issues in its comprehensive plan [(15-1102)](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=15-1102).

3.  In a city or town with less then 100,000 people, a comprehensive plan must include a land-use component
    >which designates the proposed general distributions, general location, and extent of the uses of land for agriculture, housing, commerce, industry, recreation, education, public buildings and lands, and other categories of public and private use of land. [(RSA 19-903.1)](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=19-903)

    Comprehensive plans, need not, however, address agricultural issues beyond rudimentary land use designations.



#### Require localities to protect agricultural resources in their local plans

**NO**

1.  See above.

#### Require localities to support compact/efficient development in designated growth areas

**NO**

1.  [Statute](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=23-114.02) does not require counties to adopt comprehensive plans that promote smart growth.

2. Cities of the primary class are not required to direct growth to designated growth areas. The land-use section of its comprehensive plan must only
    >show the recommended standards of population density based upon population estimates and providing for activities for which space should be supplied within the area covered by the plan. [(NE RS 15-1102)](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=15-1102)

3.  A city or town with a population less than 100,000 does not need to include smarth growth provisions in its comprehensive plan or zoning ordinance. [(RSA 19-903)](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=19-903)
