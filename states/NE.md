## Nebraska - Planning & Zoning Scorecard

### State Planning

#### State Planning Capacity

**NO**

1.  NE Department of Economic Development has a [Community Development Division](https://opportunity.nebraska.gov/grow-your-community/), but all its programming aims at *encouraging* growth, not directing it.
2.  [NE Department of Agriculture](http://www.nda.nebraska.gov/) does not offer land use programming or employ staff planners.
3.  Nebraska does not have a statewide network of regional planning commissions or councils of government. The Omaha area is served by the [Omaha-Council Bluffs Metropolitan Area Planning Agency (MAPA)](http://mapacog.org/about/what-is-mapa/), an entity formed locally, independent of state government.

####  State Plan for Agriculture

**NO**

1.  No state agency, including the [Dept. of Economic Development](https://opportunity.nebraska.gov/), the [Department of Ag.](http://www.nda.nebraska.gov/), and the [Department of Natural Resources](https://dnr.nebraska.gov/), have developed a state agriculture plan.

#### State Planning Goals Related to Agriculture

1.  

#### State provides grants or technical assistance to support development of local comprehensive plans or farmland protection plans.

#### State tracking of local plans

1.  No state age

#### State planning goals related to compact development/smart growth

1.  No state law or planning document sets forth smart growth goals.

### Local Planning

#### Requires localities to develop comprehensive plans

**PARTIAL**

1.  For NE counties, a comprehensive plan is required as a precondition for enacting zoning ordinance ([23-114.03](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=23-114.03)). Neither zoning nor a comprehensive plan are mandatory, however. [State law](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=13-301) encourages counties containing larger cities to adopt a comprehensive plan and zoning ordinance.
2.  [State law](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=14-373) requires that each city of "metropolitan class"
    >prepare a plan for its future physical development and growth.

    [NE RS 14-101](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=14-101) stipulates that cities with a population greater then 300,000 are classified as metropolitan.
3.  In any city of the [primary class](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=15-101) (population 100,000-300,000),
    >there shall be created a planning department, which shall consist of a city planning commission, a planning director, and such subordinate employees as are required to administer the planning program hereinafter set forth. [(RSA 15-1101)](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=15-1101)

    The planning director
    >shall be responsible for preparing the comprehensive plan and amendments and extensions thereto and for submitting such plans and modifications to the city planning commission for its consideration and action. [(RSA 15-1103)](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=15-1103)

4.  In a city or town with a population less than 100,000 people, a comprehensive plan is required only as a precondition for adopting zoning ordinance. [(RSA 19-901)](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=19-901)




#### Require localities to address agricultural issues in their local plans

**NO**

1.  Statute requires that county comprehensive plans address agriculture, but only in the most general terms:
    >The general plan for the improvement and development of the county shall be known as the comprehensive development plan and shall, among other elements, include:
    >
    > * (1) A land-use element which designates the proposed general distribution, general location, and extent of the uses of land for agriculture, housing, commerce, industry, recreation, education, public buildings and lands, and other categories of public and private use of land. [(23-114.02)](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=23-114.02)

2.  A city of the "primary class" does not need to address agricultural issues in its comprehensive plan [(15-1102)](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=15-1102).

3.  In a city or town with less then 100,000 people, a comprehensive plan must include a land-use component
    >which designates the proposed general distributions, general location, and extent of the uses of land for agriculture, housing, commerce, industry, recreation, education, public buildings and lands, and other categories of public and private use of land. [(RSA 19-903.1)](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=19-903)

    Comprehensive plans, need not, however, address agricultural issues beyond rudimentary land use designations.



#### Require localities to protect agricultural resources in their local plans

**NO**

1.  See above.

#### Require localities to support compact/efficient development in designated growth areas

**NO**

1.  [Statute](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=23-114.02) does not require counties to adopt comprehensive plans that promote smart growth.

2. Cities of the primary class are not required to direct growth to designated growth areas. The land-use section of its comprehensive plan must only
    >show the recommended standards of population density based upon population estimates and providing for activities for which space should be supplied within the area covered by the plan. [(NE RS 15-1102)](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=15-1102)

3.  A city or town with a population less than 100,000 does not need to include smarth growth provisions in its comprehensive plan or zoning ordinance. [(RSA 19-903)](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=19-903)
