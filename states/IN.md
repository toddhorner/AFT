## Indiana - Planning & Zoning Scorecard

### State Planning

#### State Planning Capacity

**NO**

1.  Indiana's state-level planning capacity is limited to Indiana Land Resource Commission, which is housed within the Department of Agriculture. The ILRC is a governor-appointed advisory body. They have published reports and documents regarding land use planning, zoning, and agriculture. Their work, however, focuses less on farmland conservation and **more on preventing conflict between agricultural and residential uses.** Some of their model agricultural zoning ordinance includes protections against non-agricultural development, such as requiring a special permit for any residencies that are not farm-related. Some model ordinance, however, such as their "rural estate" zone, is quite permissive of residential development that is not farm-related. Other model ordinance focuses on proper siting of contained feedlots, managing odor, and disclosing to potential buyers the implications of living in an agricultural area.
2.  The ILRC's statutory powers are set forth by IC 15-12-5-6:

    >(1) Provide technical assistance and information about land use strategies.
    >(2) Facilitate collaboration among commonly affected state, county, and local government units.
    >(3) Compile and maintain a land planning information library, both hard copy and electronic, that includes current data on land resources in Indiana.
    >(4) Establish or coordinate educational programs for governmental units, nongovernmental entities, and the public with special consideration for local planning commission members and county commissioners.
    >(5) Provide counties and local communities conducting land use planning with access to technical and legal assistance through a referral service.
    >(6) Provide information to local authorities on model ordinances for programs and techniques on land use.
    >(7) Obtain grants and assist counties and local communities in locating additional funding sources for planning projects.
    >(8) Make recommendations to the general assembly and other governmental bodies concerning land resources.
    >(9) When requested, advise the general assembly on proposals relating to land resources.

####  State Plan for Agriculture

**YES**

1.  The Indiana State Department of Agriculture publishes the [Indiana Agriculture Strategic Plan.](http://www.in.gov/isda/files/Strategic%20Plan%20Brochure.pdf). The Plan is broken into Initiatives which are supported by a list of Actions. While some Initiative address farmland conservation tangentially, none call out farmland protection explicitly. For example, under the heading "Natural Resources Stewardship and Environment," the initiative "Develop data driven, transparent agriculture advocacy strategies for our constituent groups that will allow for the success in a public policy sphere" includes as an action "Coordinate strategies to improve the management of our water, land, and air resources and communicate their research findings to farmers." This action, however, and other land-related actions in the Plan, however, focus more on sound on-farm stewardship than planning to protect farmland from development.

#### State Planning Goals Relate to Agriculture

**NO**

#### State provides grants or technical assistance to support development of local comprehensive plans or farmland protection plans.

**NO**

#### State tracking of local plans

**NO**

#### State planning goals related to compact development/smart growth

**NO**

### Local Planning

#### Requires localities to develop comprehensive plans

**YES**

1.  According to IC 36-7-501:

    >A comprehensive plan shall be approved by resolution in accordance with the 500 series for the promotion of public health, safety, morals, convenience, order, or the general welfare and for the sake of efficiency and economy in the process of development. The plan commission shall prepare the comprehensive plan.

2.  However, there is no legislative mandating the *update* of comprehensive plans. According the ILRC:

    >Many counties throughout the state have comprehensive
plans that are 20-30 years old.
