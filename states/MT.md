### Local Planning

#### Requires localities to develop comprehensive plans

**NO**

1. In Montana, comprehensive plans are referred to as growth management policies, which counties and municipalities are authorized to adopt [(MT MCA 76-1-601)](http://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/76/1/76-1-601.htm). According to the MT Community Development Division
	>growth policies are not required by Montana statute, unless a local government wishes to adopt or amend municipal or county zoning regulations. 

#### Require localities to address agricultural issues in their local plans

**YES**

1.	Growth policies must contain a statement that explains how local governments will:
	> evaluate and make decisions regarding proposed subdivisions with respect to the ʺpublic interestʺ criteria established in section 76‐3‐608 (3)(a), MCA. The public interest criteria are agriculture, agricultural water user facilities, local services, the natural environment, wildlife and wildlife habitat, and public health and safety. [(Planning Board Handbook, 26)](http://comdev.mt.gov/Portals/95/shared/CTAP/docs/CTAPPublications/CTAPPublications/PLBoardHandbk.pdf)

#### Require localities to protect agricultural resources in their local plans

**NO**

1. A growth policy may include an optional infrastructure plan. *If* a growth policy *does* include an infrastructure plan, then said infrastructure plan *must* include
	> a description of how and where projected development inside municipal boundaries for cities and inside designated joint infrastructure planning areas for cities and counties could adversely impact [...] agricultural lands and agricultural production. [(MCA 76-1-701)](http://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/76/1/76-1-601.htm)

	Note that the optional infrastructure plan must include only a *description* of potential development impacts on agriculture. It does not require any action to prevent forecast impacts.

#### Require localities to support compact/efficient development in designated growth areas

**NO**

1.	According to [MCA 76-1-601](http://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/76/1/76-1-601.htm), A city's growth policy may optionally support smart growth:
	> * (4) A growth policy may
	>	* (c) establish an infrastructure plan that, at a minimum, includes:
	> 		* (iv) for cities, land use map showing where projected growth will be guided and at what densities within city boundaries
