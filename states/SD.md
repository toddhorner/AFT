## South Dakota - Planning & Zoning Scorecard

### State Planning

#### State Planning Capacity

**NO - NEED TO CONFIRM**

1.  No state agency focuses on land use or planning issues, including the Dept. of Ag., the Governor's Office of Economic Development, Bureau of Finance and Management, Bureau of Admin.
2.  South Dakota has a network of planning districts that span most, but not all, of the state. They engage in comprehensive planning and zoning activities, but it is not clear from online material whether or not they receive support from the state for those activities. They are independently organized, voluntary associations of municipal governments.  I've e-mailed land use planners at several councils of government for comment.

####  State Plan for Agriculture

**NO**

1.  As mandated by the 2008 Farm Bill, SD created a [forestry action plan](https://sdda.sd.gov/conservation-forestry/forest-stewardship/assessment-of-forest-resources/), but not a farm aciton plan.

#### State Planning Goals Relate to Agriculture

**NO**

1.  Statute does not set forth planning goals related to agriculture, nor does any state agency publication.

#### State provides grants or technical assistance to support development of local comprehensive plans or farmland protection plans.

**NO - NEED TO CONFIRM**

1.  No state agency seems to have a mission of the capacity to track local plans, but I'm confirming with practitioners. At least some SD Councils of Government provide technical assistance on planning issues, but aid is likely funded through local contributions.

#### State tracking of local plans

**NO - NEED TO CONFIRM**

1.  No state agency seems to have a mission of the capacity to track local plans, but I'm confirming with practitioners.

#### State planning goals related to compact development/smart growth

**NO - NEED TO CONFIRM**

1.  Statute does not set forth any goals related to smart growth, nor does any agency publication.

### Local Planning

#### Requires localities to develop comprehensive plans

**YES**

1.  According to State Code [11-6-2](http://sdlegislature.gov/Statutes/Codified_Laws/DisplayStatute.aspx?Type=Statute&Statute=11-6-2):

    >each municipality of the state shall provide by ordinance for a planning and zoning commission, including the appropriation of money to a fund for the expenditures of such commission and to provide by ordinance the qualifications of the members, mode of appointment, tenure of office, compensation, powers, duties of and rules governing such board. Municipalities shall, as soon as possible, make, adopt, amend, extend, add to or carry out a general municipal plan of development, such plan to be referred to as the comprehensive plan.

    It's bizarre that statute requires that towns adopt comprehensive plan, but offers no mechanisms for monitoring or enforcing plan enactment.


#### Require localities to address agricultural issues in their local plans

**NO**

1.  Statute sets forth the contents of a general plan only in the most general terms, and does not call out agriculture:

    >In the preparation of the comprehensive plan, the planning commission shall make careful and comprehensive surveys and studies of the existing conditions and probable future growth of the municipality and its environs. The plan shall be made with the purpose of guiding and accomplishing a coordinated, adjusted, and harmonious development of the municipality, which will, in accordance with existing and future needs, best promote health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity or the general welfare, as well as efficiency and economy in the process of development. (State Code 11-6-15)

#### Require localities to protect agricultural resources in their local plans

**NO**

1.  See above.

#### Require localities to support compact/efficient development in designated growth areas

**NO**

1.  See above.
