## North Dakota - Planning & Zoning Scorecard

### State Planning

#### State Planning Capacity

**NO**

1.  From personal correspondence with Larry Weil, Board Member of the North Dakota APA chapter:
    > Currently there are no state agencies that provide guidance to local jurisdictions with statewide plans or model ordinances.  The State did have a State Planning Agency many years ago which was repurposed in the early 1980s.  The Department of Commerce is of assistance to communities when administrating federal grants with funds funneled through the Department of Commerce.

####  State Plan for Agriculture

**NO**

1.  The [ND Department of Agriculture](https://www.nd.gov/ndda/) has neither a division nor programming related to land use planning.
2.  No other state entity has published either a plan for agriculture or a food systems plan.
3.  The City of Fargo has published a [Metropolitan Food Systems Plan](http://download.cityoffargo.com/0/metropolitan_food_systems_plan_final_november_2013-1.pdf) that includes land use and agriculture elements.


#### State Planning Goals Relate to Agriculture

**NO**
1.  ND statute does not set forth planning goals related to agriculture. Neither does any official state publication.

#### State provides grants or technical assistance to support development of local comprehensive plans or farmland protection plans.

**NO**

1.  From personal correspondence with Larry Weil:
    >The state does not provide technical assistance or funding at this time.  During the oil boom, the state helped support an effort (Legislative funding support for Vision West) to help to a limited extent those communities impacted by the boom.  The effort included the development of guidelines for communities to develop plans and ordinances, and provided several training workshops).  The Department of Commerce did propose some funding a few years ago to assist communities in the development of comprehensive plans, however was not supported by the Legislature.

    He notes non-state resources for ND planners and local officials:
    >There is an association, The North Dakota Planning Association, made up of professional planners, local officials and others, whose mission is to support planning in the state.  The Association has been a resource to communities throughout the state by being a network to help educate communities, have conducted planning and zoning training for lay planners (Planning Commissions) and local officials, publishes a newsletter for members, as a benefit to membership provides The Western Planner Journal (multi-state network of state planning associations and chapters of The American Planning Association) and access to the Western Planners Conference, provides assistance to the North Dakota League of Cities, and holds an annual conference.

2.  Regarding regional planning commissions, Larry Weil writes:
    >The State does have 8 regional councils or development authorities which were organized initially to support regional and local planning and received federal (Department of Housing and Urban Development) and state funding.  As federal funding vanished, most regional councils sought more local funding and administrative fees for grants administration.  Many changed their mission to federal grants administrators for local communities.  Few have maintained any professional expertise to help local communities with comprehensive planning or zoning.  Communities desiring to develop plans and ordinances generally contract services with a consulting firm and cover the costs locally.

#### State tracking of local plans

**NO**

1.  According to Larry Weil:
    >The State does not track adoption and updates of local comprehensive plans.

#### State planning goals related to compact development/smart growth

**NO**

1.  From personal correspondence with Larry Weil:
    >The State has not adopted goals related to smart growth.

### Local Planning

#### Requires localities to develop comprehensive plans

**NO**

1.  In the absense of a planning commission, a municipal master plan is optional. NDCC [40-48-02](http://www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t40c48.pdf#nameddest=40-48-01) states that:
    >Any municipality, by an ordinance of its governing body, may establish an official master plan of the municipality.

    A municipality may optionally create a planning commissions (NDCC 40-48-03). State law dictates that a planning commissions
    > shall make and adopt a master plan for the physical development
    of the municipality and of any land outside its boundaries which, in the commission's judgment, bears a relation to the planning of the municipality.

2. According to [NDCC 11-33-04](http://www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t11c33.pdf#nameddest=11-33-04), if counties wish to enact land use regulations, they must appoint a planning commission. NDCC 11-33-07 mandates that a county planning commissions *shall* prepare a plan.


#### Require localities to address agricultural issues in their local plans

**NO**

1.  NDCC 40-48-08 stipulates contents of a municipal master plan. Agriculture is not included as either a required or optional component.
2.  NDCC 40-48-09 describes studies that must be conducted before development of a municipal master plan, but agriculture is not included in their specification.
3.  [NDCC 11-33-03](http://www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t11c33.pdf#nameddest=11-33-07) specifies the object of *county* land use regulations:
    >These regulations shall be made in accordance with a comprehensive plan and designed for any or all of the following purposes:
        - (1) To protect and guide the development of nonurban areas.
        - (5) To conserve and develop natural resources

4. NDCC 11-33-02.1 stipulates requirements for county agricultural regulations. These requirements, however, focus on regulations pertaining to contained feedlot operations. They also set forth right-to-farm provisions.

#### Require localities to protect agricultural resources in their local plans

**NO**

1.  See above.

#### Require localities to support compact/efficient development in designated growth areas

**NO**

1.  As stated above, NDCC 40-48, Sections 8 and 9 stipulates the contents of a municipal master plan, as well as studies that must support plan development. The required components of a plan are as follows:
    - The general locations, character, and extent of streets, waterways, waterfronts, playgrounds, plazas, squares, and open spaces, parks, aviation fields, and other public ways and grounds;
    - The general location of public buildings and other public property;
    - The general location and extent of public utilities and terminals whether publicly or privately owned or operated;
    - The removal, relocation, widening, narrowing, vacation, abandonment, change of use, or extension of any of the foregoing ways, grounds, open spaces, buildings, property, terminals, or utilities; and
    - Other matters authorized by law.

    As can be seen, municipal master plans need not support compact growth.


2.  As stated above,  [NDCC 11-33-03](http://www.legis.nd.gov/cencode/t11c33.pdf#nameddest=11-33-07) specifies the object of *county* land use regulations:
    >These regulations shall be made in accordance with a comprehensive plan and designed for any or all of the following purposes:
        - (1) To protect and guide the development of nonurban areas.
        - (5) To conserve and develop natural resources

    County comprehensive plans need not specify required development densities or growth areas.
