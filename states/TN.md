## Tennessee- Planning & Zoning Scorecard

### State Planning

#### State Planning Capacity

**YES**

1.  The Tennessee Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (TACIR) publishes research publications on a range or topics related to local governance, including land use. TACIR is also tasked with monitoring the state's Growth Policy (see below).
2.  The Local Government Planning Advisory Committee, [established by Tennessee Code 4-3-727](https://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/tncode/), and filled through gubernatorial appointment, approves county Growth Plans (see below)

####  State Plan for Agriculture

**NO**

1.  The TN Department of Agriculture published the [Tennessee Forest Action Plan](https://www.tn.gov/agriculture/topic/ag-forests-action-plan), which

    >provides a comprehensive analysis of the forest-related conditions, trends, threats, and opportunities within the state using a combination of qualitative, quantitative, and geospatial data that provides information relevant to key issues to the state while also addressing national priorities of conserving, protecting and enhancing the forest resource.

    The 2008 Farm Bill mandated that all states conduct a comprehensive analysis of their forests, so this probably doesn't deserve any partial credit.

#### State Planning Goals Related to Agriculture

**NO**

1.  Vague state planning goals could perhaps be inferred by requirements set forth by the Growth Management Act. No statute or official state publication, however, establishes specific, measurable goals related to farmland preservation.

#### State provides grants or technical assistance to support development of local comprehensive plans or farmland protection plans.

**YES**


1.  The Growth Management Act encourages coordinating to committees to seek technical service from:
    - Department of Economic and Community Development,
    - the county technical assistance service,
    - and the municipal technical advisory service

    The Dept. of Economic and Community Development, however, does not appear to offer land use-related services. The municipal technical advisory service has published technical guides on developing growth plans. It also conducts workshops on a host of municipal government matters, including land use (no trainings are scheduled regarding comprehensive or growth plans). Also, the Municipal Technical Advisory Service is housed within the University of Tennessee Institute for Public Service, which functions as the state's extension service. The County Technical Assistance Service is also housed within the Institute for Public Service.

2.  The Tennessee Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations has published guides regarding land use in the state.

#### State tracking of local plans

**YES**

1.  Although no online evidence suggests that any state entity is tracking comprehensive plans, the Tennessee Advisory Council on Intergovernmental Relations tracks Growth Plan, amendments, and [their approval by the Local Government Planning Advisory Committee.](https://www.tn.gov/tacir/article/tacir-pc1101-growth-plan-approvals)

#### State planning goals related to compact development/smart growth

**YES**

1.  The Tennessee Growth Policy Act, otherwise known as Public Chapter 1101, "intends to establish a comprehensive growth policy" that:

  > (1) Eliminates annexation or incorporation out of fear;
  > (2) Establishes incentives to annex or incorporate where appropriate;
  > (3) More closely matches the timing of development and the provision of public services;
  > (4) Stabilizes each county's education funding base and establishes an incentive for each county legislative body to be more interested in education matters; and
  > (5) **Minimizes urban sprawl**.

However, TACIR has found significant limitations in the Growth Policy Act:

  > The stated purpose of Tennessee’s Growth Policy Act was to establish a comprehensive growth policy for the state, part of which was a requirement to designate urban growth boundaries, planned growth areas, and rural areas based on projections of growth over a 20-year period that is soon coming to an end. These growth plans do not expire, and there is also no requirement to update them.
  >
  > *Municipal Growth Boundaries in Tennessee - Annexation and Growth Planning Policies after Public Chapter 207.* Tennessee Advisory Council on Intergovernmental Relations. (January, 2015).

Also, it's interesting to note that the Growth Policy Act's furtherance of smart growth principles was auxiliary to its aims of resolving conflicts over annexation:

  > While the focus of the Act was to deal with Tennessee’s tumultuous battles over annexation and incorporation, it was also an a empt to further growth planning statewide.

### Local Planning

#### Requires localities to develop comprehensive plans

**NO**

1.  Municipalities are authorized, but not required, to create a planning commission:

    >The chief legislative body of any municipality, whether designated board of aldermen, board of commissioners or by other title, may create and establish a municipal planning commission. (TN Code 13-4-401 (a) (1))

2.  Municipal planning commissions, if created by the municipality's chief legislative body, must prepare and adopt a comprehensive plan:

    > It is the function and duty of the commission to make and adopt an official general plan for the physical development of the municipality, including any area outside of its boundaries which, in the commission's judgment, bears relation to the planning of the municipality. (TN Code 13-4-201)

3.  Although localities aren't required to adopt comprehensive plans, it should be noted that counties, through intergovernmental coordination commissions (see below), are required to adopt growth plans. Growth plans must include the following:

    - **Urban Growth Boundaries (UGB)** - regions which contain the corporate limits of a municipality and the adjoining territory where growth is expected.
    - **Planned Growth Areas (PGA)** - compact sections outside incorporated municipalities where growth is expected (if there are such areas in the county), and where new incorporations may occur.
    - **Rural Areas (RA)** - territory not within 1 of the other 2 categories which is to be preserved for agriculture, recreation, forest, wildlife, and uses other than high-density commercial or residential development.

4.  In more detail, statute defines the three growth plan components in the following manner:

    - A growth plans's urban growth boundary "shall":
      >- (1) (A)  Identify territory that is reasonably compact yet sufficiently large to accommodate residential and nonresidential growth projected to occur during the next twenty (20) years;
      >
      >- (B)  Identify territory that is contiguous to the existing boundaries of the municipality;
      >
      >- (C)  Identify territory that a reasonable and prudent person would project as the likely site of high density commercial, industrial and/or residential growth over the next twenty (20) years based on historical experience, economic trends, population growth patterns and topographical characteristics; if available, professional planning, engineering or economic studies, or any of these studies, may also be considered;
      >
      >-  (D)  Identify territory in which the municipality is better able and prepared than other municipalities to efficiently and effectively provide urban services; and
      >
      >-  (E)  Reflect the municipality's duty to facilitate full development of resources within the current boundaries of the municipality and to manage and control urban expansion outside of such current boundaries, taking into account the impact to agricultural lands, forests, recreational areas and wildlife management areas.
      >
      > - (2)  Before formally proposing urban growth boundaries to the coordinating committee, the municipality shall develop and report population growth projections; such projections shall be developed in conjunction with the University of Tennessee. The municipality shall also determine and report the current costs and the projected costs of core infrastructure, urban services and public facilities necessary to facilitate full development of resources within the current boundaries of the municipality and to expand such infrastructure, services and facilities throughout the territory under consideration for inclusion within the urban growth boundaries. The municipality shall also determine and report on the need for additional land suitable for high density, industrial, commercial and residential development, after taking into account all areas within the municipality's current boundaries that can be used, reused or redeveloped to meet such needs. The municipality shall examine and report on agricultural lands, forests, recreational areas and wildlife management areas within the territory under consideration for inclusion within the urban growth boundaries and shall examine and report on the likely long-term effects of urban expansion on such agricultural lands, forests, recreational areas and wildlife management areas.

    - Each planned growth area of a county shall:
      > - (A)  Identify territory that is reasonably compact yet sufficiently large to accommodate residential and nonresidential growth projected to occur during the next twenty (20) years;
      >
      > - (B)  Identify territory that is not within the existing boundaries of any municipality;
      >
      > - (C)  Identify territory that a reasonable and prudent person would project as the likely site of high or moderate density commercial, industrial and/or residential growth over the next twenty (20) years based on historical experience, economic trends, population growth patterns and topographical characteristics; (if available, professional planning, engineering and/or economic studies may also be considered);
      >
      > - (D)  Identify territory that is not contained within urban growth boundaries; and
      >
      > - (E)  Reflect the county's duty to manage natural resources and to manage and control urban growth, taking into account the impact to agricultural lands, forests, recreational areas and wildlife management areas.

      Reporting similar to that require for urban growth boundaries is also required for planned growth areas.

    - Each rural area shall:

      > - (A)  Identify territory that is not within urban growth boundaries;
      >
      > - (B)  Identify territory that is not within a planned growth area;
      >
      > - (C)  Identify territory that, over the next twenty (20) years, is to be preserved as agricultural lands, forests, recreational areas, wildlife management areas or for uses other than high density commercial, industrial or residential development; and
      >
      > - (D)  Reflect the county's duty to manage growth and natural resources in a manner that reasonably minimizes detrimental impact to agricultural lands, forests, recreational areas and wildlife management areas.

#### Require localities to address agricultural issues in their local plans

**YES**

1.  TN Code 13-4-201 sets forth components that a comprehensive plan "may include," but does not touch upon agriculture.
2.  Growth Plans, however, as mandated by the Growth Management Act of 1999, requires cities and counties to establish urban growth boundaries. Those urban growth boundaries shall:
    > reflect the municipality's duty to facilitate full development of resources within the current boundaries of the municipality and to manage and control urban expansion outside of such current boundaries, taking into account the impact to agricultural lands, forests, recreational areas and wildlife management areas.
    >
    > TN State Code 6-58-106 (a)(1)(E)

#### Require localities to protect agricultural resources in their local plans

**YES**
1.  As stated above, Growth Plans

#### Require localities to support compact/efficient development in designated growth areas

**YES**

1. TN Code 13-4-201 requires that comprehensive plans show the planning commission's recommendations regarding physical development, but does not stipulate any criteria, let along smart growth criteria, inform those recommendations.
2. The TN Growth Management Act created Growth Plan Coordinating Committees in each county. Each county's committee was composed of the following members:

    >(A) The county executive or the county executive's designee, to be confirmed by the county legislative body; provided, however, a member of the county legislative body may serve as such designee subject to such confirmation;
    >(B) The mayor of each municipality or the mayor's designee, to be confirmed by the municipal governing body;
    >(C) One (1) member appointed by the governing board of the municipally owned utility system serving the largest number of customers in the county;
    >(D) One (1) member appointed by the governing board of the utility system, not municipally owned, serving the largest number of customers in the county;
    >(E) **One (1) member appointed by the board of directors of the county's soil conservation district, who shall represent agricultural interests;**
    >(F) One (1) member appointed by the board of the local education agency having the largest student enrollment in the county;
    >(G) One (1) member appointed by the largest chamber of commerce, to be appointed after consultation with any other chamber of commerce within the county; and
    >(H) Two (2) members appointed by the county executive and two (2) members appointed by the mayor of the largest municipality, to assure broad representation of environmental, construction and homeowner interests.

    The Coordinating Committee is charged with developing and adopting a Growth Plan, which shall

    >identify urban growth boundaries for each municipality within the county and shall identify planned growth areas and rural areas within the county (TN Code 6-58-104 (a)(2)). See above for more details.
