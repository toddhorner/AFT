## Tennessee- Planning & Zoning Scorecard

### State Planning

#### State Planning Capacity

**YES**

1.  The Tennessee Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (TACIR) publishes research publications on a range or topics related to local governance, including land use. TACIR is also tasked with monitoring the state's Growth Policy (see below).
2.  The Local Government Planning Advisory Committee, [established by Tennessee Code 4-3-727](https://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/tncode/), and filled through gubernatorial appointment, approves county Growth Plans (see below)

####  State Plan for Agriculture

#### State Planning Goals Related to Agriculture

**YES**



#### State provides grants or technical assistance to support development of local comprehensive plans or farmland protection plans.

#### State tracking of local plans

**YES**

1.  Although no online evidence suggests that any state entity is tracking comprehensive plans, the Tennessee Advisory Council on Intergovernmental Relations tracks

#### State planning goals related to compact development/smart growth

**YES**

1.  The Tennessee Growth Policy Act, otherwise known as Public Chapter 1101, "intends to establish a comprehensive growth policy" that:

  > (1) Eliminates annexation or incorporation out of fear;
  > (2) Establishes incentives to annex or incorporate where appropriate;
  > (3) More closely matches the timing of development and the provision of public services;
  > (4) Stabilizes each county's education funding base and establishes an incentive for each county legislative body to be more interested in education matters; and
  > (5) **Minimizes urban sprawl**.

However, TACIR has found significant limitations in the Growth Policy Act:

  > The stated purpose of Tennesseeâ€™s Growth Policy Act was to establish a comprehensive growth policy for the state, part of which was a requirement to designate urban growth boundaries, planned growth areas, and rural areas based on projections of growth over a 20-year period that is soon coming to an end. These growth plans do not expire, and there is also no requirement to update them.

### Local Planning

#### Requires localities to develop comprehensive plans

**NO**

1.  Municipalities are authorized, but not required, to create a planning commission:

    >The chief legislative body of any municipality, whether designated board of aldermen, board of commissioners or by other title, may create and establish a municipal planning commission. (TN Code 13-4-401 (a) (1))

2.  Municipal planning commissions, if created by the municipality's chief legislative body, must prepared and adopt a comprehensive plan:

    > It is the function and duty of the commission to make and adopt an official general plan for the physical development of the municipality, including any area outside of its boundaries which, in the commission's judgment, bears relation to the planning of the municipality. (TN Code 13-4-201)


#### Require localities to address agricultural issues in their local plans

**NO**

1.  TN Code 13-4-201 sets forth components that a comprehensive plan "may include," but does not touch upon agriculture.

#### Require localities to protect agricultural resources in their local plans

**NO**
1.  See above.

#### Require localities to support compact/efficient development in designated growth areas

**NO**

1. TN Code 13-4-201 require that comprehensive plans show the planning commission's recommendations regarding physical development, but does not stipulate any criteria, let along smart growth criteria, inform those recommendations.
