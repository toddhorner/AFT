## South Carolina - Planning & Zoning Scorecard

### State Planning

#### State Planning Capacity

**NO - NEED TO CONFIRM**

1.  The SC Dept. of Commerce [does not perform](https://www.sccommerce.com/) land use planning or community development functions.
2.  The [South Carolina Association of Regional Councils](http://sccogs.org/services.html) states that
    >each COG provides a broad range of planning expertise to local governments, including comprehensive planning, zoning and land use regulation, strategic planning, planning administration, economic and community development, historic preservation and community revitalization planning.

    Online materials, however, do not specify whether planning assistance is funded by state monies.

####  State Plan for Agriculture

**NO**

1.  Although some SC localities have adopted food systems plans, no state entity has published either a plan for agriculture or a food systems plan.

#### State Planning Goals Relate to Agriculture

**NO**

1.  Since no state entity's mission includes planning, the only planning "goals" come from statute. Although state code requires that a comprehensive plan include a land use element, which must, in turn, address agriculture, statute does not set forth any particular goals related to agriculture.

#### State provides grants or technical assistance to support development of local comprehensive plans or farmland protection plans.

**NO - NEED TO CONFIRM**

1.  Regional Councils do provide comprehensive planning assistance, but online materials do not suggest that such assistance is funded or otherwise supported by state government. State government websites offer little in the way of technical planning publications or guides. The only guides that I've been able to find come from the municipal associations.

#### State tracking of local plans

**NO - NEED TO CONFIRM**

1.  No online evidence suggests that any state entity tracks local comprehensive plans.

#### State planning goals related to compact development/smart growth

**NO**

1.  Since no state entity's mission includes planning, the only planning "goals" come from statute. Although state code requires that a comprehensive plan include a land use element, which must, in turn, address agriculture, statute does not set forth any particular goals related to smart growth.

### Local Planning

#### Requires localities to develop comprehensive plans

**PARTIAL**

1.  According to [SC State Law 6-29-320](http://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t06c029.php):

    >The city council of each municipality **may** create a municipal planning commission. The county council of each county may create a county planning commission.

    A local planning commission then "has the power and the duty to":

    >(1) prepare and revise periodically plans and programs for the development and redevelopment of its area as provided in this chapter;

    Under Article 3 of Chapter 6-29, "Local Planning - The Comprehensive Planning Process," the local planning commission is mandated to

    > develop and maintain a planning process which will result in the systematic preparation and continual re-evaluation and updating of those elements considered critical, necessary, and desirable to guide the development and redevelopment of its area of jurisdiction

2.  Per SC State Law 6-29-720, municipalities must adopt a comprehensive plan in order to adopt zoning ordinance:

    > When the local planning commission has prepared and recommended and the governing body has adopted at least the land use element of the comprehensive plan as set forth in this chapter, the governing body of a municipality or county may adopt a zoning ordinance to help implement the comprehensive plan. The zoning ordinance shall create zoning districts of such number, shape, and size as the governing authority determines to be best suited to carry out the purposes of this chapter.

#### Require localities to address agricultural issues in their local plans

**YES**

1.  Local comprehensive plans must contain a land use element

    >which considers existing and future land use by categories, including residential, commercial, industrial, **agricultural**, forestry, mining, public and quasi-public, recreation, parks, open space, and vacant or undeveloped;

#### Require localities to protect agricultural resources in their local plans

**NO**

1.  While the land use component of an comprehensive plan must consider agricultural uses, it need not protect them.

#### Require localities to support compact/efficient development in designated growth areas

**NO**

1.  The transportation element should consider "pedestrian a bicycle projects," but no explicit requirements or incentives for smart growth are legislated.
