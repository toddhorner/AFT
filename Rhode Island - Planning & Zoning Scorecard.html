          <li style="line-height: 1.6;">LUP 7: Promote the establishment of higher residential densities and smaller lot frontages in urban and suburban areas, and town centers, where public water and sewer service is present or planned. In areas that lack supporting infrastructure,
            promote conservation development and identification of appropriate sites for village centers that will provide compact mixed-use areas for locating services, commercial space, housing, and public transportation hubs. </li>
