## New Hampshire - Planning & Zoning Scorecard

### State Planning

#### State Planning Capacity

1.  <span style="color:green">**YES**</span>
2.  [The mission of the Planning Division of the Office of Energy and Planning](https://www.nh.gov/oep/planning/index.htm) is to provide
    >programs, services, and resources to assist decision makers on issues pertaining to development, land protection, and community planning to guide the State's future growth through programs, public policy development, education and outreach, research, and partnership building.


####  State Plan for Agriculture

#### State Planning Goals Relate to Agriculture
1.  **YES**
2.  [NH RSA 675:17](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/LXIV/674/674-17.htm) states that zoning ordinances "shall be designed:"
    > To encourage the preservation of agricultural lands and buildings and the agricultural operations described in RSA 21:34-a supporting the agricultural lands and buildings;

3.  NH "Right to Farm" statutes recognize the benefits of agriculture, but aim primarily at *restricting* zoning ordinance that burdens agriculture:
    >Agriculture makes vital and significant contributions to the food supply, the economy, the environment and the aesthetic features of the state of New Hampshire, and the tradition of using the land resource for agricultural production is an essential factor in providing for the favorable quality of life in the state. Natural features, terrain and the pattern of geography of the state frequently place agricultural land in close proximity to other forms of development and commonly in small parcels. Agricultural activities are a beneficial and worthwhile feature of the New Hampshire landscape. Agritourism, as defined in RSA 21:34-a, is undertaken by farmers to contribute to both the economic viability and the long-term sustainability of the primary agricultural activities of New Hampshire farms. Agricultural activities and agritourism shall not be unreasonably limited by use of municipal planning and zoning powers or by the unreasonable interpretation of such powers

    [NH RSA 672:1](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/LXIV/672/672-mrg.htm)



#### State provides grants or technical assistance to support development of local comprehensive plans or farmland protection plans.

1. **YES**
2.  According to [NH RSA:3-a](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/LXIV/673/673-3-a.htm), the new members of local planning or zoning boards:
    >may complete training offered by the office of energy and planning. The office of energy and planning may provide this training, which may be designed in a variety of formats including, but not limited to, web-based, distance learning, traditional classroom style, or self study.

    Note that training is not *mandatory*.



#### State tracking of local plans

1. **YES**
2. The Planning Division conducts an [annual survey](https://www.nh.gov/oep/planning/services/mrpa/land-use-survey.htm) of municipal land use regulations, including whether or not municipalities have adopted a plan or not. The survey is voluntary. In 2016, 129 out of 234 municipalities responded.

#### State planning goals related to compact development/smart growth

1.  **YES**
2.  [Chapter 9-B](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/I/9-B/9-B-mrg.htm) of NH State Statute, entitled *STATE ECONOMIC GROWTH, RESOURCE PROTECTION, AND PLANNING POLICY*, lays out multiple findings and goals related to smarth growth. For example, section 9-B:1, states that:
    > II. Economic development is essential to the well-being and prosperity of our citizens. However, when haphazard development sprawls across the state's landscape, our collective well-being suffers. Fortunately, economic development can take place in a form that maximizes smart growth,

    while section 9-B:2 declares:
    >It shall be the policy of the state of New Hampshire that state agencies act in ways that encourage smart growth.

3.  Section 9-B:3, defines smart growth, linking the concept with preservation of open space, including farmland:
    > In this chapter, "smart growth'' means the control of haphazard and unplanned development and the use of land which results over time, in the inflation of the amount of land used per unit of human development, and of the degree of dispersal between such land areas. "Smart growth'' also means the development and use of land in such a manner that its physical, visual, or audible consequences are appropriate to the traditional and historic New Hampshire landscape. Smart growth may include denser development of existing communities, encouragement of mixed uses in such communities, the protection of villages, and planning so as to create ease of movement within and among communities. Smart growth preserves the integrity of open space in agricultural, forested, and undeveloped areas. 

4. [NH RSA 674:2](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/lxiv/674/674-2.htm)states that the:
    >The purpose of the master plan is to set down as clearly and practically as possible the best and most appropriate future development of the area under the jurisdiction of the planning board, to aid the board in designing ordinances that result in preserving and enhancing the unique quality of life and culture of New Hampshire, and to guide the board in the performance of its other duties in a manner that **achieves the principles of smart growth, sound planning, and wise resource protection**. (emphasis added)

### Local Planning

#### Requires localities to develop comprehensive plans
1.  **NO**
2.  Under NH RSA 674:1 I, a municipal planning board must *"prepare and amend from time to time a master plan to guide the development of the municipality."* A municipality, however, need not have a planning board [(NH RSA 673:1 I)](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/LXIV/673/673-1.htm). It *may* establish a planning board, if it chooses to do so.
3. See also, the Nashua Regional Planning Commission's publication [*The Master Plan in New Hampshire*](http://www.nashuarpc.org/files/5814/2988/4524/The_Master_Plan_in_NH_Final_2013-10-17.pdf), which states:
    >In New Hampshire, a master plan is *not* a legal document, and it is not required under the law



#### Require localities to address agricultural issues in their local plans

1. **NO**
2.


#### Require localities to protect agricultural resources in their local plans

2. **NO**
