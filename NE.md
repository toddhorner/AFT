### Local Planning

#### Requires localities to develop comprehensive plans

1.  For NE counties, a comprehensive plan is required as a precondition for enacting zoning ordinance ([23-114.03](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=23-114.03)). Neither zoning nor a comprehensive plan are mandatory, however.
2.  

#### Require localities to address agricultural issues in their local plans

1.  Statute requires that county comprehensive plans address agriculture, but only in the most general terms:
    >The general plan for the improvement and development of the county shall be known as the comprehensive development plan and shall, among other elements, include:
    >
    > * (1) A land-use element which designates the proposed general distribution, general location, and extent of the uses of land for agriculture, housing, commerce, industry, recreation, education, public buildings and lands, and other categories of public and private use of land. [(23-114.02)](http://nebraskalegislature.gov/laws/statutes.php?statute=23-114.02)

#### Require localities to protect agricultural resources in their local plans

#### Require localities to support compact/efficient development in designated growth areas
