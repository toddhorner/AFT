## Missouri - Planning & Zoning Scorecard

### State Planning

#### State Planning Capacity

**NO**

1.  The MO Department of Economic Development offers "community planning" resources, but none of those resources relate directly to land use, zoning, or comprehensive planning.
2.  The Office of Administration is the state's official planning agency. According to RSA [261.170](http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=251.170&bid=13425&hl=):
    >The office of administration is hereby designated as the official state planning agency for the purpose of providing planning assistance to counties, municipalities, metropolitan planning areas, and regional planning commissions herein created when requested by such local governmental unit or planning commission to do so, and for such purposes is authorized to:
      > * (1) Contract with public agencies or private persons or organizations for any purposes of sections 251.010 to 251.440;

    The referenced statutes outline "purposes" generally related to local government, but nothing specific to comprehensive planning or zoning. Here, "planning" refers to technical assistance in general.


3.  The Office of Administration *does* provide some funds to MO's network of regional planning councils. According to the [Missouri Association of Councils of Government](http://www.macogonline.org/partners.htm):
      >With legislative approval, Missouri's Regional Planning Commissions receive an annual disbursement of funds to facilitate regional planning throughout the state.

      Statute requires the regional planning councils match statue funds with local funds. State funds are limited to $25,000 per council, except for the Mid-American Regional Council and the East-West Gateway Coordinating Council, for which funding is limited to \$65,000.

4.    RPCs also receive funds from other state agencies (e.g. DOT) and federal entities. MO RPCs are incorporated independently from state government. Municipal membership is voluntary. While some RPCs help localities craft comprehensive plans, the role of an RPCs vary considerably, depending on the communities they serve.
