## Missouri - Planning & Zoning Scorecard

### State Planning

#### State Planning Capacity

**NO**

1.  The MO Department of Economic Development offers "community planning" resources, but none of those resources relate directly to land use, zoning, or comprehensive planning.
2.  The Office of Administration is the state's official planning agency. According to RSA [261.170](http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=251.170&bid=13425&hl=):
    >The office of administration is hereby designated as the official state planning agency for the purpose of providing planning assistance to counties, municipalities, metropolitan planning areas, and regional planning commissions herein created when requested by such local governmental unit or planning commission to do so, and for such purposes is authorized to:
      > * (1) Contract with public agencies or private persons or organizations for any purposes of sections 251.010 to 251.440;

    The referenced statutes outline "purposes" generally related to local government, but nothing specific to comprehensive planning or zoning. Here, "planning" refers to technical assistance in general.


3.  The Office of Administration provides a small amount of funding to MO's network of regional planning councils. According to the [Missouri Association of Councils of Government](http://www.macogonline.org/partners.htm):
      >With legislative approval, Missouri's Regional Planning Commissions receive an annual disbursement of funds to facilitate regional planning throughout the state.

    [Statute](http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=251.034&bid=13410&hl=) requires the regional planning councils match statue funds with local funds. State funds are limited to $25,000 per council, except for the Mid-American Regional Council and the East-West Gateway Coordinating Council, for which funding is limited to \$65,000.

4.    RPCs also receive funds from other state agencies (e.g. DOT) and federal entities. MO RPCs are incorporated independently from state government. Municipal membership is voluntary. While some RPCs help localities craft comprehensive plans, the role of an RPCs vary considerably, depending on the communities they serve.


####  State Plan for Agriculture

**NO**

1.  Checked Dept. of Ag., Office of Administration, Environmental Improvement and Energy Resources Authority.


#### State Planning Goals Relate to Agriculture

**NO**

1.  The only statute related to farmland preservation is the "[Missouri Farmland Trust Act](http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=262.815&bid=14199)," which empowers the Department of Agriculture to receive or acquire farmland or easements. Aside from statute itself, no evidence suggests that the trust was ever incorporated or its advisory board appointed. Even if the trust does exist, its mission to "protect and preserve Missouri's farmland," isn't connected with state planning goals.

#### State provides grants or technical assistance to support development of local comprehensive plans or farmland protection plans.

**NO**
1.  Contacted MACOG President Doug Hermes, by [phone](<tel:18167818631>) and [email](mailto:djhermes@kc.rr.com). Waiting to hear back.

#### State tracking of local plans

**NO**
1.  No state agency exists with the capacity or mission to track state plans.

#### State planning goals related to compact development/smart growth

**NO**

1.  No state statute, administrative code, or agency publication discusses density or form of urban development

---

### Local Planning

#### Requires localities to develop comprehensive plans

**NO**

1.  According to [RSA 64.040](http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=64.040&bid=2442&hl=), counties "shall have the power" to make and adopt a master plan, but are not required to.
2. According to [RSA 89.310](http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=89.310&bid=4629&hl=), municipalities have the power to create a zoning plan, but are not required to.


#### Require localities to address agricultural issues in their local plans

**NO**

1.  [RSA 64.040](http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=64.040&bid=2442&hl=) describes the contents of county plans. A master plan
    > shall be developed so as to conserve the natural resources of the county, to insure efficient expenditure of public funds, and to promote the health, safety, convenience, prosperity and general welfare of the inhabitants.

    Agriculture is not cited as a required topic.

2.  [RSA 89.340](http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=89.340&bid=4632) describes the contents of a city zoning plan. Agriculture (or any form of natural resource conservation) is not included as a manadated or optional section.

#### Require localities to protect agricultural resources in their local plans

**NO**

1. See above.

#### Require localities to support compact/efficient development in designated growth areas

**NO**

1.  As stated above, [RSA 64.040](http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=64.040&bid=2442&hl=) specifies contents of county plans, while [RSA 89.340](http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=89.340&bid=4632) does so for cities, and requires only that plans
    >show the commission's recommendations for the physical development and uses of land.

    Statute does not require that those recommendations meet any guidelines, including those related to smart growth.
