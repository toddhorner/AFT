3. RI State Planning Council
	- Adopts State Guide Plan [(RIGL 42-11-10)](http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/Statutes/TITLE42/42-11/42-11-10.HTM)
	- Reviews proposals for state projects, assessing consistency with State Guide Plan
	- Reviews local comprehensive plans
	- Delegates and designees appointed by heads of state departments

####  State Plan for Agriculture

1. <span style="color:green">**YES**</span>
2. A Vision for Rhode Island Agriculture
	- Published by the RI Agricultural Partnership, a non-profit group.
	* Development funded, at least in part, by the van Buren Charitable Foundation
	* State planning and agriculture staff participated in development, both in working groups and advisory committee.

3. Rhode Island Food Strategy
	* Developed under the leadership of the state's Director of Food Strategy, a position created and staffed through the Governor's Office. The position is made possible through philanthropic support, most notably by the Henry P. Kendall Foundation
	* The Strategy encompasses production, economic development, and health. It recognizes the importance of farmland preservation:
		> As discussed, access to land and reasonably-sized step-up facilities is cited as one of the biggest impediments to  the  growth  of  production  in  Rhode  Island.  This strategy supports the development and expansion of programs to preserve working landscapes and make them more accessible to all Rhode Islanders – for agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries, and other forms of food production and processing. (Rhode Island Food Strategy, 10)


#### State Planning Goals Relate to Agriculture

1. <span style="color:green">**YES**</span>
2. [RI General Law 42-11-10](http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/Statutes/TITLE42/42-11/42-11-10.HTM) established the RI State Guide Plan, which the state government uses to guide long-term decisions regarding land use, economic development, and other sectors in which the state maintains an active interest. The land use component of the State Guide Plan, titled "[Rhode Island State Land Use Policies and Plan,](http://www.planning.ri.gov/documents/guide_plan/landuse2025.pdf)" establishes as one of its goals: "Preserve the best farmland and active farms in the State for active agricultural use"
3. [RI General Law 2-23.1-1 (a)](http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/Statutes/TITLE2/2-23.1/2-23.1-1.HTM) finds that "the preservation and expansion of agriculture are goals of the state."
4. The Rhode Island Local Agriculture and Seafood Act ([RIGL 2-25](http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/Statutes/TITLE2/2-25/2-25-3.HTM)) sets forth the following legislative intentions:
	- To support and develop more robust and self-sustaining agricultural and seafood sectors that also promotes emerging agricultural industries;
	- That policies and programs of the state will support and promote the Rhode Island agriculture and seafood industries as a vital component of the state's economy and essential steward of our land and coastal waters;
	- That current policies and programs pertaining to the viability of Rhode Island's agricultural and seafood industries be reviewed and confirmed or changed in order to assure the long-term economic prosperity of the industries; and
	- That Rhode Island will promote processing and consumption of agricultural and seafood products from within Rhode Island.

#### State provides grants or technical assistance to support development of local comprehensive plans or farmland protection plans.

1. <span style="color:green">**YES**</span>
2. ["The Division of Planning is committed to assisting municipalities in crafting comprehensive plans that are effective at guiding local decision making and are an embodiment of the State’s goals and policies."](http://www.planning.ri.gov/planning-areas/local-comprehensive-planning/)
2. The RI Division of Planning has created a range of materials to support local comprehensive planning, including:
	- A handbook series, including a [whole handbook devoted to planning for agriculture.](http://www.planning.ri.gov/documents/comp_handbook/7_Agriculture.pdf)
	- Data factsheets for municipalities
	- GIS Layer Files

#### State tracking of local plans

1. <span style="color:green">**YES**</span>
2. According to [Section 45-22.2-9](http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/Statutes/TITLE45/45-22.2/45-22.2-9.HTM) of the RI General Laws,  municipalities *must* submit new or updated comprehensive plans to the State Division of Planning for review and approval.
3. The State Division of Planning also conducts [periodic reviews](http://www.planning.ri.gov/documents/tp/148.pdf) of local zoning ordinance.

#### State planning goals related to compact development/smart growth

1. <span style="color:green">**YES**</span>
2. Land Use Goal (LUG) 1 of the [State Land Use Plan](http://www.planning.ri.gov/documents/guide_plan/landuse2025.pdf) states "A sustainable Rhode Island that is beautiful, diverse, connected and compact with a distinct quality of place in our urban and rural centers, and abundance of natural resources, and a vibrant sustainable economy."
	- Under the rubric of LUG 1, the Plan establishes Land Use Objective (LUO) 1A: "Focus growth within the urban services boundary and in centers of different sizes and types; support traditional centers instead of new development. "
3. The Plan outlines Land Use Policies (LUP's) to "guide activities toward fulfillment of their plan goals." Several LUP's pertain to smart growth:
	- LUP 2: Control sprawl and the urban exodus of business and industry.
	- LUP 3: Use open space to control and shape urban growth.
	- LUP 7: Promote the establishment of higher residential densities and smaller lot frontages in urban and suburban areas, and town centers, where public water and sewer service is present or planned.  In areas that lack supporting infrastructure, promote conservation development and identification of appropriate sites for village centers that will provide compact mixed-use areas for locating services, commercial space, housing, and public transportation hubs.

### Local Planning

#### Requires localities to develop comprehensive plans

1. <span style="color:green">**YES**</span>
2. ["The Comprehensive Planning and Land Use Regulation Act, enacted in 1988 and amended in 2011, requires every Rhode Island city and town to adopt a Comprehensive Plan."](http://www.planning.ri.gov/publications/state-guide-plan.php)

#### Require localities to address agricultural issues in their local plans
1. <span style="color:green">**YES**</span>
2. [RI General Law](http://webserver.rilin.state.ri.us/Statutes/TITLE45/45-22.2/45-22.2-9.HTM) requires that local plans are consistent with state goals and policies. In order to guide municipalities, the state publishes a [comprehensive planning standards manual](http://www.planning.ri.gov/documents/comp_handbook/0_Standards.pdf). The manual includes standards regarding agriculture, including:
	- 7.1 Identify valuable agricultural soils on a map.
	- 7.2 Include an inventory of significant agricultural operations by identifying:
		- The locations and types of active agricultural operations; and
		- Farm lands that have been protected from development, even if currently idle.
	- 7.3 Assess the role of agriculture as part of the municipality’s existing types and patterns of economic
activity by describing:
		- The scale of the agricultural sector in the community, including supporting uses such as
processing centers, distribution centers, etc.; and
		- The overall trend in the agricultural sector, for example expanding, contracting, diversifying, etc
	- 7.6 Include implementation actions within the Implementation Program that address:
		- Preserving the best farmland for agricultural use;
		- Keeping active farms in agricultural use and promoting the active use of idle agricultural land;
		- Expanding the agricultural sector; and
		- Capitalizing on the existing agricultural opportunities.

#### Require localities to protect agricultural resources in their local plans

1. <span style="color:green">**YES**</span>
2. See above, especially planning standard 7.6

#### Require localities to support compact/efficient development in designated growth areas

1. <span style="color:green">**YES**</span>
2. Land use components of local plans must be consistent with the state's land use map (as depicted in the land use portion of the State Guiding Plan). Any inconsistencies must be justified with explanatory narrative. Urban areas, as shown by the state land use map, must have a minimum density of 1-5 dwelling units per acre. Conservation/limited areas must have a *maximum* density of 1 dwelling unit per acre.
